# Project 2: DMalloc

<!-- TODO: Fill this out. -->

## Design Overview:

This project consisted on implementing functions similar to those used
to allocate and free dynamic memory, but with the end goal of debugging and finding errors.
More specifically, the project worked on:

- Track information about dynamic memory allocation.
- Catch common memory programming errors (e.g., freeing the same block twice, trying to allocate too much memory etc).
- Detect a write outside a dynamically allocated block (e.g., writing 65 bytes into a 64-byte piece of memory).
- Other more general programming errors.

Working on this mainly lead me to understand what goes behind the scenes for certain errors and really solidify my understanding on memory allocation (what is does, how it works, what are the potential errors that may arise).

## How long did it take to complete DMalloc?

<!-- Enter an approximate number of hours that you spent actively working on the project. -->

10 Hours :) (Map function is what took me the longest)
